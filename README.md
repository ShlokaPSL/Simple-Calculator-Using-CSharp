# Simple-Calculator-Using-CSharp

This application accepts two numeric inputs and an operator from the user.

The numbers can be integers or decimal values.

The operators can be entered in the form of the symbol of the desired operation or in plain English [-, sub, subtract, subtraction : all are valid inputs for the operator and are case-insensitive].
For now, only the four basic operations are considered [add, sub, mul, div].

The application would then perform the operation and display the result.
[At all points in the application, valid checks are in place so as to display appropriate messages to the user in case the operation cannot be performed or something goes wrong.]
